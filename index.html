			<p class="response">Growing up with deaf family members is definitely something I'm not familiar with, run me down some things in your daily life that you felt would be different if your parents could hear.</p>

			<p class="response">Wow, it's actually surreal thinking about how different things would be. From little things like not having to sign for my parents when they want to order food at a restaurant, not having lights flash when the phone or doorbell is ringing, my friends and my parents having more of a relationship rather than just "hi", "hi", "how are you", etc; my parents being friends with my friend's parents, not having to constantly get my moms attention with my hand when we are in the same room, definitely not being able to get away with blasting music in my room at 2am or singing loudly when I'm driving with my mom/dad, we definitely wouldnt have the vcr which is like facetime but for deaf people where they have a speaking sign language interpreter on the other end for when they have to call places like the doctor's office, insurance, school's, etc. Obviously I make it work and have been so accustomed to so many things that I'm probably forgetting. But there are things like emotional connections and being able to really talk about how I feel without having to write it down sometimes as there are lots of feelings that don't have the right sign word to capture that feeling. I remember signing for my parents at the doctors, being at my own parent-teacher conferences to sign for my teachers, and honestly just having to grow up a lot faster than other kids my age. </p>

			<p class="response">Philadelphia, Pa; Just very urban and cold. I have very limited memories from this period of my life but a significant story from this time was my pre-school burning down. Haha everyone ended up safe but I can vividly remember being woken up from nap time in a panic and having to be led out with all my classmates to a building across the street. I remember leaving school that day and seeing all the ash from the remains, especially a Thomas the train pillow that was barely recognizable. We ended up holding school at a nearby building in the area for the remainder of the year. Bonita Springs, FL; this was such a great time to go through the early grades of the k-12 system. The weather was always so humid and warm, with nice light chilly falls/ winters. I remember having all the hallways be basically outdoors with awnings above. The kids were very lively and spontaneous and just had so much energy (i mean which kid doesn't at kindergarten, first grade). I don't really remember any significant landmarks besides the mini deserts/ fields around my house and the one time I got bed bugs from playing in a field. Paramus, NJ: Where I live now is definitely what I would call my hometown. I've lived in three different houses in just this one town alone, the first two were rented and the last is where my family has finally purchased our home. I really came to true form living here through the many art programs held at my middle and high schools. The people here are definitely higher income compared to the people in Florida. A LOT of privilege, ignorance, money, but also pretty intelligent, liberal, and artistic kids sprinkled throughout. Classic suburbia with alot of urbanized elements (5 shopping malls, 10+ Starbucks, huge highway with shops all alongside) and I guess a significant landmark is seeing the NYC skyline in the distance lol. </p>

			<p class="response">You seem to have interest in both photography and fashion, what made you want to pursue communication design despite both of these being possible creative careers on their own?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="josh">
			<h1 class="name_green">Josh</h1>
			<p class="response">As much as I love Photography and Fashion I realized being a creative director is something that I really would like to see myself doing after graduation. I believe communication design is such an important major for building a strong foundation rooted in design and creative thinking and when it comes down to all my artistic interests, one of my biggest strengths is thinking about how to visually communicate my ideas in the most efficient way possible. I am planning on minoring in photography so I can still take classes and just exercise my love for it. I'm taking a History of fashion photography class this semester actually! And for fashion, I think it's something that is a great career for so many, but for myself speaking, my interest in fashion leans more on my own personal expression, my love for shopping, and just constantly expanding my wardrobe. I wouldn't mind taking a history of fashion class although. </p>

			<p class="response">You seem to have several scars, but the one that interests me is the one behind your left ear. How'd you get that one?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="josh">
			<h1 class="name_green">Josh</h1>
			<p class="response">I got this scar when I was about 3 years old. I was living in Philadelphia at the time with my parents and my great aunt, Tita Pat. I was playing trampoline on a sofa that was right near a large window with an ac radiator right beneath it. As I fell my ear hit the corner of the radiator that had a sharp edge to it and it ended up leaving a 2-inch scar right behind my left ear. My mom was mortified. </p>

			<p class="response">You also mention your obsession with tattoos, yet you don't even have one. Describe your obsession, is it just that you really want one or that you really admire people with them, or maybe something completely different.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="josh">
			<h1 class="name_green">Josh</h1>
			<p class="response">Definitely both. I think I'm so obsessed with tattoos that I have so many ideas of what I want and where that I get so overwhelmed with where to start. I love the personality tattoos can give off and especially when there are beautiful meanings/stories associated with them. I definitely want every tattoo to be purposeful and have a reason to be on my body. They really are an art form in itself. I always appreciate people I see with entire tattoo sleeves or even people that have them more subtle and scattered all over varying parts of the body (I wanna be those people). I also just love the fact at when you are wearing a plain or monochrome outfit and then have the tattoos be able to exist at the forefront, elevating your entire appearance. It's like jewelry, a perfect design accent. </p>

My favorite artists of all time are definitely: Amy Winehouse, Thundercat, Paramore, The Neighbourhood, Arctic Monkeys, Lana Del Rey, Mariah Carey, SZA, Tennis and The Flaming Lips. </p>

		</div>
		<div class="josh">
			<h1 class="name_green">Josh</h1>
			<p class="response">Yes, one of my best friends is a girl I met in 5th grade in the same town I live currently in. Her name is Ellie. She's 19 and is one of the most passionate artists I've ever met. She really brings out the extrovert in me and we just have that friendship of being so stupid and silly all the time it makes us die of laughter every day. She's a Leo, has 4 other siblings, is the best at accents/voices, has the cutest round-shaped Rayban glasses, and has a very niche/ dark sense of humor. Through much of middle school and high school we loved art club, going to the mall, walking all over town, thrifting, doing photoshoots, getting Starbucks, helping each other with art projects, and sending each other the funniest videos we found. We both constantly share what we are working on in art and help each other with concepts, design elements, color choices, etc. I love how much we have evolved from our early days and is someone I can say I grew up with. I love her like a sister and we can go a while without seeing each other, but when we do, it's like no time has passed at all! </p>

			<p class="response">What is your horoscope and do you think your personality matches up with its traits?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="josh">
			<h1 class="name_green">Josh</h1>
			<p class="response">I'm a Capricorn sun and a double Gemini. I definitely can see the pragmatism, overly ambitious, need to be productive constantly, doing things in a precise but efficient manner, being quite intuitive, doing a lot of self-reflection, being responsible, constantly giving advice and helping those I love, and making a consistent cycle of goals to accomplish - all coming from the Capricorn with me. I'm very action-oriented and try to make the best use out of whatever I have/ comes my way. I try not to let challenges stump me but rather redirect me. I'm very much a control freak and like everything quite organized. I really don't like the perfectionism, high standards, workaholic attitude I can really bury myself in. But I just know it comes from an outlet of being responsible and trying to constantly get things done so I can keep evolving and becoming stronger. Although I definitely differ a bit from the traditional Capricorn in that I do love to let loose (maybe more than I will admit lol), have a fun sense of humor, and constantly seek adventures all around me. I always try not to put my viewpoints and beliefs onto others. Nor do I try to put me on a high pedestal and seem I'm constantly wiser than everyone else. Nuh uh. I have a very deep appreciation for life, self-development, change, coming out of our comfort zone, and introspection. </p>

		</div>
		<div class="josh">
			<h1 class="name_green">Josh</h1>
			<p class="response">I love reading anything in the political thriller/drama world. Like if there are any books that resemble the House Of Cards dynamic please show them my way. I'm so fascinated by political corruption and all the chaos behind the scenes. I also love philosophy and I'm currently reading a book by Introduction to Positive Philosophy by Auguste Comte (the father of philosophy). I also just love drama, Big Little Lies, and books about teenagers (Palo Alto; Girl, Interrupted). </p>
